      /*
       Function along with lexical scope bundle together.
       A closure in JavaScript is a powerful feature that allows a function to retain access 
       to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. In simpler terms,
       a closure is created when a function is defined within another function and retains access to 
       the variables of the outer function.
       Uses of Closures
       - Module Design Pattern
       - Currying
       - Function like once (function which called only onnce)
       - memoize
       - maintainting state in async world
       - setTimeouts
       - Iterators
