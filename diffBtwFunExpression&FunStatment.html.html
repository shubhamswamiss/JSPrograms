        /* what are first class function or first class citizen ?
          First-class functions mean that functions in JavaScript can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures.
          This feature is fundamental to many advanced programming techniques and paradigms in JavaScript
          The ability to use functions as values and can be pass this aa an argument to another function
          and can be return from the functions is known as first class functions.

          when they are treated as a value passed into another functions or returned from antoher functions
